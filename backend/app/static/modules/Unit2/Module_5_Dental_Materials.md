# Module 5: Dental Materials

**Program:** Atlanta Academy of Dental Assisting – 1200-Hour Dental Assistant Certificate Program  
**Unit:** Unit 2 – Core Clinical Skills  
**Module:** Module 5 – Dental Materials  
**Hours:** 45 Didactic / 55 Lab / 0 Clinical  
**Standards:** ABHES (Dental Assisting), OSHA, CDC; State: Georgia

## Purpose
Develop competency in selecting, mixing, and delivering dental materials including impression compounds, gypsum, cements, amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, and provisional materials within manufacturer and infection control parameters.

## Learning Objectives (by Domain)
**Cognitive:**
- Compare physical properties (strength, solubility, dimensional change) of common dental materials.  
- Select appropriate gypsum type for casts, dies, and opposing models.  
- Describe setting reactions and manipulation variables for alginate, PVS, zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, resin cements, amalgam, and composites.  
- Explain safety data (SDS) and hazard mitigation for monomers, mercury, and etchants.  
- Outline provisional restoration criteria.

**Psychomotor:**
- Measure powder/liquid ratios, vacuum mix gypsum, and pour casts free of voids.  
- Load impression trays, seat on typodont/patient, disinfect, and wrap for lab transport.  
- Triturate amalgam, load carriers, condense into typodont preps, carve anatomy.  
- Manipulate composites with matrix/wedge, cure to specification, finish/polish.  
- Fabricate acrylic or bis-acryl provisional crowns.

**Affective:**
- Maintain organized, contamination-free material stations.  
- Demonstrate accountability for lot numbers and expiration dates.  
- Exhibit patience and fine-motor focus when correcting defects.

## Key Terms & Definitions
- **Alginate (Irreversible Hydrocolloid)** — Impression material setting by chemical reaction, ideal for study casts.  
- **Polyvinyl Siloxane (PVS)** — Addition silicone impression material with high dimensional stability.  
- **Gypsum Types I–V** — Classification of plaster/stone/die stone based on compressive strength.  
- **Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC)** — Fluoride-releasing restorative/cementing material bonding to tooth structure.  
- **Resin-Modified Glass Ionomer (RMGI)** — Hybrid material offering enhanced strength and light-curing capability.  
- **Amalgam Trituration** — Mechanical mixing of alloy powder and mercury.  
- **Matrix System** — Retainer, band, wedges used to form proximal walls.  
- **C-factor** — Configuration factor impacting polymerization shrinkage stress.  
- **Provisional Restoration** — Temporary crown/bridge protecting preparation between visits.  
- **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** — Hazard communication document for each material.

## Didactic Content
### Material Science Review
- Elastic vs. inelastic impression materials; hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic behavior.  
- Working/setting times, tear strength, shelf-life storage.

### Gypsum & Casts
- Water/powder ratios, vacuum mixing advantages, separating casts, trimming safety.  
- Common errors (air entrapment, improper spatulation) and fixes.

### Cements & Restoratives
- Zinc phosphate exothermic reaction and mixing slab technique.  
- Polycarboxylate biocompatibility, resin adhesives, glass ionomer fluoride release.  
- Amalgam indications, mercury hygiene, waste management.  
- Composite layering, curing light maintenance, oxygen inhibition layer considerations.

### Provisionalization
- Criteria: margins, occlusion, esthetics, patient comfort.  
- Acrylic vs. bis-acryl vs. CAD/CAM temporaries.

### Adhesive & Restorative Innovations
- Bulk-fill composites vs. conventional incrementals; depth-of-cure considerations and need for supplemental curing when proximal boxes exceed 4 mm.  
- Bioactive materials (RMGI liners, calcium silicate bases) that promote remineralization and decrease postoperative sensitivity.  
- Universal adhesives: etch-and-rinse vs. self-etch modes, effect of contamination, and strategies for selective enamel etching.  
- Light-curing science: irradiance verification with radiometers, effect of angulation and distance, required eye protection, and maintenance logs for curing lights.

### Troubleshooting & QA
| Error | Likely Cause | Corrective Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voids/bubbles in impressions | Tray removed too quickly, inadequate mix | Extend working time with cooler water, seat tray posterior-first, vibrate to release air |
| Amalgam fracture at margins | Insufficient condensation, early finishing | Increase condensation pressure, verify amalgam reaches a dull surface before carving |
| Composite pull-back | Over-drying dentin, inadequate bonding | Maintain moist dentin per manufacturer, scrub adhesive for full dwell time, air-thin properly |
| Provisional poor contacts | Matrix not contoured, inadequate trimming | Burnish matrix prior to placement, adjust proximal surfaces with discs and re-polish |
| Gypsum cast surface voids | Entrapped air, dirty impression | Vibrate stone onto impression slowly, rinse/disinfect impression thoroughly before pour |


### Interactive Activity – Materials Troubleshooting Dialog Cards
(H5P: `M5_H5P_MaterialsDialogcards`)

Use the flashcard deck to rehearse real-world defect scenarios (alginate tear-outs, gypsum voids, amalgam fracture, adhesive pull-back, provisional contacts, SDS follow-up). Discuss your remediation plan with a lab partner before moving to the bench.

## Laboratory / Skills
- **Alginate & Gypsum Lab:** Practice facial impressions, disinfect, pour, trim casts.  
- **Amalgam Lab:** Triturate, condense, carve on typodont with safety shields.  
- **Composite Station:** Apply bonding agents, incremental fill, cure, finish.  
- **Provisional Crown Lab:** Use matrix, mix bis-acryl, adjust occlusion/polish.  
- **Light-Curing QA:** Measure irradiance using radiometer, chart output, replace batteries/bulbs per SOP.  
- **Failure Analysis Bench:** Inspect intentionally flawed specimens to diagnose causes and document corrective steps.  
- PPE: utility gloves, masks, protective eyewear, mercury spill kit on standby.  
- **Competency Sign-off:** Successful impression with ≤1 void, cast with intact anatomy, Class II restoration (amalgam or composite) meeting rubric criteria.

## Assessments
- Written exam on material properties and manipulation variables.  
- Lab rubric covering impression, cast, and restorative tasks.  
- SDS quiz focusing on hazard mitigation steps.
- Case-based worksheet requiring students to choose materials for complex scenarios (pediatric stainless-steel crown vs. adult Class II composite).  
- Reflective log documenting three material errors encountered during lab and the remediation applied.

## Documentation & Records
- Laboratory prescription form for external labs.  
- Material lot/expiration log.
