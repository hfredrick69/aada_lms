# Module 9: Dental Emergency Procedures & CPR

**Program:** Atlanta Academy of Dental Assisting – 1200-Hour Dental Assistant Certificate Program  
**Unit:** Unit 2 – Core Clinical Skills  
**Module:** Module 9 – Dental Emergency Procedures & CPR  
**Hours:** 30 Didactic / 20 Lab / 0 Clinical  
**Standards:** ABHES (Dental Assisting), OSHA, CDC; State: Georgia

## Purpose
Prepare students to recognize, prevent, and respond to medical and dental emergencies, and to maintain current BLS/CPR certification with AED proficiency.

## Learning Objectives (by Domain)
**Cognitive:**
- Identify common in-office emergencies (syncope, allergic reaction, asthma, angina, hypoglycemia, seizures, anaphylaxis).  
- Outline emergency drug kit contents and indications.  
- Describe emergency preparedness protocols, roles, and documentation.  
- Summarize AHA BLS algorithms for adult, child, and infant patients.  
- Explain infection control considerations for emergency response.

**Psychomotor:**
- Perform CPR cycles with high-quality compressions and ventilations using pocket masks or bag-valve masks.  
- Operate AED trainers, follow prompts, and ensure scene safety.  
- Take and document vital signs pre/post events.  
- Set up oxygen and nitrous equipment for emergency use.  
- Assist with EpiPen administration, airway positioning, and suctioning.

**Affective:**
- Maintain calm communication while coordinating emergency roles.  
- Demonstrate empathy toward patients and families during stressful events.  
- Commit to continual skill refreshers beyond certification minimums.

## Key Terms & Definitions
- **Syncope** — Transient loss of consciousness due to decreased cerebral perfusion.  
- **Angina Pectoris** — Chest pain from myocardial ischemia; relieved by nitroglycerin.  
- **Hypoglycemia** — Low blood glucose causing confusion, sweating, seizures.  
- **Anaphylaxis** — Severe systemic allergic reaction requiring epinephrine.  
- **AED (Automated External Defibrillator)** — Device analyzing cardiac rhythms and delivering shocks.  
- **Epinephrine Autoinjector** — Pre-filled device delivering emergency medication intramuscularly.  
- **Emergency Action Plan (EAP)** — Written protocol assigning roles, equipment, and communication steps.  
- **CAB Sequence** — Compressions, Airway, Breathing order for CPR.  
- **Oropharyngeal Airway (OPA)** — Device maintaining airway patency.  
- **Post-Event Debriefing** — Review to improve systems and documentation.

## Didactic Content
### Emergency Preparedness
- Risk assessment, medical history red flags, ASA classification tie-in.  
- Emergency kit inventory: oxygen, epinephrine, nitroglycerin, albuterol, antihistamines, aspirin, glucose, bronchodilators.  
- Crash cart checks, expiration tracking, location signage.

### Recognition & Management
- Detailed algorithms for fainting, hyperventilation, asthma attack, hypoglycemia, angina/MI, stroke, airway obstruction, seizures, allergic reactions.  
- Dental emergencies: avulsed tooth, broken instrument, aspiration.  
- Pain and anxiety control collaboration with Module 13 (nitrous monitoring).

### Sedation & Pharmacologic Considerations
- Nitrous oxide oversedation management (oxygen flush, airway support, monitoring).  
- Oral conscious sedation overview: medications commonly prescribed, assistant role in verifying doses, and post-op monitoring instructions.  
- Drug interactions to watch for (beta blockers + epinephrine, anticoagulants, hypoglycemics) and how to alert the dentist.  
- Emergency drug dose calculations based on weight for pediatric patients; reference charts maintained at emergency cart.

### CPR/BLS Protocols
- Adult/child/infant compression ratios, depth, recoil, ventilation volumes.  
- AED pad placement variations, shock safety, resuming compressions.  
- Infection control modifications (barrier devices) post-pandemic.

### Documentation & Legal Follow-up
- Completing incident reports, EHR notes, and OSHA logs within required timelines.  
- Communicating with malpractice carriers when directed by dentist/owner.  
- Patient dismissal and referral letters after emergencies; ensuring transport documentation accompanies patient.  
- Debriefing process: root-cause analysis, psychological safety for staff, action plans to prevent recurrence.

### Interactive Activity – Emergency Response Quick Check
(H5P: `M9_H5P_EmergencySingleChoice`)

Run through five rapid-fire single-choice scenarios (syncope, nitrous oversedation, hypoglycemia, AED use, anaphylaxis). Use the debrief to update the emergency action plan roles.

## Laboratory / Skills
- **BLS Mega Code:** Instructor-led circuits practicing compressions, ventilations, AED usage.  
- **Emergency Kit Stations:** Identify drugs/equipment, demonstrate assembly, oxygen delivery with nasal cannula and non-rebreather.  
- **Scenario Simulations:** Role-playing front-desk communication, EMS activation, documentation.  
- **Sedation Monitoring Drill:** Integrate Module 13 skills—monitor vitals during nitrous administration, recognize oversedation, implement oxygen flush.  
- **Team Command Exercises:** Assign Incident Commander, airway lead, medication nurse, and scribe roles to practice delegation and closed-loop communication.  
- Safety: use disposable lungs on manikins, disinfect between users, wear gloves/eye protection when practicing suction.  
- **Competency Sign-off:** Pass AHA or equivalent BLS practical and mock emergency drill evaluation.

## Assessments
- Written exam on medical emergency differentials.  
- Skill checklists for CPR/AED and emergency kit deployment.  
- After-action report assignment analyzing simulation performance.  
- Emergency preparedness binder review—students audit a mock binder for completeness (EAP, contacts, maintenance logs) and recommend updates.  
- Peer evaluation of teamwork using TeamSTEPPS-based rubric.

## Documentation & Records
- Emergency log, incident report, patient dismissal note template, drug kit inventory sheet.  
- Sedation monitoring record, crash cart maintenance tag, and post-incident debriefing form.

## ABHES / OSHA / CDC Cross-Reference
- ABHES DA1, DA3.  
- OSHA requires Emergency Action Plans; CDC provides interim guidance for resuscitation PPE.  
- Georgia: maintain current BLS certification for direct patient contact.

## Required Resources
- Adult/child/infant manikins, AED trainers, bag-valve masks, oxygen tanks/regulators, nasal cannulas, non-rebreather masks, emergency drug kit, mock medications, suction units.
