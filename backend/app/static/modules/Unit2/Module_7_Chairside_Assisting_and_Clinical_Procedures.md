# Module 7: Chairside Assisting & Clinical Procedures

**Program:** Atlanta Academy of Dental Assisting – 1200-Hour Dental Assistant Certificate Program  
**Unit:** Unit 2 – Core Clinical Skills  
**Module:** Module 7 – Chairside Assisting & Clinical Procedures  
**Hours:** 40 Didactic / 55 Lab / 0 Clinical  
**Standards:** ABHES (Dental Assisting), OSHA, CDC; State: Georgia

## Purpose
Train students in four-handed dentistry, operatory efficiency, field isolation, matrix systems, and temporization techniques that support restorative and surgical procedures.

## Learning Objectives (by Domain)
**Cognitive:**
- Explain principles of motion economy, operator zones, and instrument sequencing.  
- Compare isolation options (cotton rolls, dry angles, rubber dam, high-volume evacuation).  
- Describe indications for matrices, wedges, and retraction cord.  
- Outline steps for temporary restorations and direct pulp capping support.  
- Discuss ergonomics and musculoskeletal injury prevention.

**Psychomotor:**
- Set up operatories using the 12 o’clock clock concept.  
- Transfer instruments using single/double-handed methods with safety in mind.  
- Position HVE and air-water syringe for optimal evacuation and visibility.  
- Place Tofflemire and sectional matrix systems, contour wedges, burnish bands.  
- Fabricate and adjust temporary restorations on typodont teeth.

**Affective:**
- Collaborate with operators using anticipatory guidance.  
- Foster calm chairside demeanor that reassures patients.  
- Identify ergonomic adjustments proactively to preserve personal health.

## Key Terms & Definitions
- **Four-Handed Dentistry** — Coordinated actions of operator and assistant to maximize efficiency.  
- **Operating Zones** — Clock positions (operator, assistant, transfer, static) around the dental chair.  
- **High-Volume Evacuator (HVE)** — Device removing large volumes of fluids/debris.  
- **Transfer Zone** — Area where instrument exchange occurs safely.  
- **Matrix Band** — Metal or plastic strip forming temporary wall for restorations.  
- **Wedge** — Inserts interproximally to seal matrix and recreate contact.  
- **Crown/Bridge Provisional** — Temporary covering protecting prepared teeth.  
- **Ergonomics** — Science of fitting tasks to human capabilities to reduce strain.  
- **Cavit G** — Common temporary filling material.  
- **Field Isolation** — Techniques to keep operative site dry and accessible.

## Didactic Content
### Operatory Design & Ergonomics
- Assistant stool adjustments, fulcruming, neutral posture, microbreaks.  
- Instrument tray setup: preset cassettes, bur blocks, disposables.  
- Time-motion principles: classify movements I–V; aim for I–III.

### Isolation & Retraction
- HVE positioning cues, fulcrums for retraction, saliva ejector vs. HVE roles.  
- Field isolation decision tree (patient tolerance, procedure type, moisture level).  
- Moisture control for adhesive dentistry.

### Matrices & Temporization
- Tofflemire assembly, retainer placement, band contouring, removal order.  
- Sectional matrix systems for Class II composites, ring placement, contact formation.  
- Provisional options: acrylic, bis-acryl, aluminum shell, stainless steel crown (ped).  
- Occlusal adjustment using articulating paper, finishing/polishing burs.

### Interactive Activity – Chairside Workflow Knowledge Check
(H5P: `M7_H5P_ChairsideMultiChoice`)

Select all behaviours that align with efficient four-handed dentistry (assistant positioning, HVE control, matrix placement, ergonomic microbreaks). Compare reasoning with a lab partner and log any posture adjustments in your ergonomics journal.

### Surgical & Specialty Support
- Oral surgery setups: sterile field maintenance, suction management, passing surgical instruments, and documenting count sheets.  
- Endodontic assisting: rubber dam coordination, rotary file transfer, irrigation safety, working length communication.  
- Orthodontic procedures: bracket bonding trays, archwire changes, elastic education, and multi-patient flow management.  
- Sedation support: pre-procedure verification, monitoring vitals, ensuring emergency drugs/equipment are present (ties to Module 9/13).

### Communication & Workflow Management
- Anticipatory guidance scripts (“next instrument” cues, verbalizing bur changes) for efficient four-handed flow.  
- Integration of digital checklists or tablets for operatory turnover, implant cassettes, and specialty trays.  
- Closed-loop communication during critical tasks (e.g., surgical forceps exchanges) to prevent drops or sharps injuries.  
- Documentation standards for chairside notes, lab prescriptions, and provisional cementation records.

## Laboratory / Skills
- **Operatory Setup Drill:** Timed exercise to set tray, armamentarium, and barriers for amalgam and composite procedures.  
- **Instrument Transfer Lab:** Practice mirror/handpiece transfers with eyes closed for safety.  
- **Matrix & Wedge Station:** Build Class II restorations on typodonts, evaluate contacts using floss.  
- **Temporary Restoration Lab:** Prepare and seat provisional crowns; evaluate margins and occlusion.  
- **Specialty Rotation Simulation:** Teams rotate through oral surgery, endodontic, and orthodontic stations applying discipline-specific setups and communication cues.  
- **Ergonomic Video Review:** Record posture during procedures, annotate with musculoskeletal risk notes, and develop corrective action plans.  
- Safety: maintain posture cues, use fulcrums, enforce PPE and HVE for aerosol control.  
- **Competency Sign-off:** Instructor verifies correct four-handed assisting posture, HVE placement, and matrix restoration meeting rubric.

## Assessments
- Chairside systems written quiz.  
- Lab rubric covering four-handed transfer, isolation, and temporization tasks.  
- Peer feedback logs on ergonomics observations.  
- Scenario-based assessment where students triage simultaneous operator requests, prioritize tasks, and document rationale.  
- Reflection essay linking ergonomic data to personal wellness plan (stretch sequence, equipment adjustments).

## Documentation & Records
- Operatory turnover checklist, matrix usage log, temporary crown record (material, shade, lot).  
- Ergonomic self-assessment worksheet.
- Specialty setup checklists and surgical instrument count sheets.  
- Communication log template capturing procedural briefings and debriefings.

## ABHES / OSHA / CDC Cross-Reference
- ABHES DA3, DA4.  
- OSHA ergonomics best practices, OSHA BBP for aerosol-generating procedures.  
- CDC interim infection control considerations for AGPs.

## Required Resources
- Treatment chairs, assistant stools, preset cassettes, HVE tips, saliva ejectors, Tofflemire retainers, sectional matrix kits, wedges, provisional materials, articulating paper, finishing burs.
