# Module 6: Dental Radiography

**Program:** Atlanta Academy of Dental Assisting – 1200-Hour Dental Assistant Certificate Program  
**Unit:** Unit 2 – Core Clinical Skills  
**Module:** Module 6 – Dental Radiography  
**Hours:** 40 Didactic / 50 Lab / 0 Clinical  
**Standards:** ABHES (Dental Assisting), OSHA, CDC; State: Georgia

## Purpose
Teach radiation physics, biology, and imaging techniques so students can safely acquire diagnostic-quality radiographs in compliance with ALARA principles and Georgia radiography regulations.

## Learning Objectives (by Domain)
**Cognitive:**
- Explain x-ray generation, exposure factors, and image receptor technology.  
- Discuss radiation biology, dose units, and protective measures.  
- Compare paralleling vs. bisecting angle techniques and indications.  
- Describe error recognition and corrective actions for digital sensors and phosphor plates.  
- Summarize Georgia radiography certification requirements.

**Psychomotor:**
- Assemble XCP holders, position sensors, align PID for paralleling technique on manikins.  
- Capture bitewings, periapicals, panoramic exposures using digital systems.  
- Process PSP plates, mount full-mouth series, and label structures.  
- Implement infection control for sensors (barriers, wipes) and equipment.

**Affective:**
- Prioritize patient/operator safety with shielding and dosimetry.  
- Communicate empathetically to reduce patient anxiety.  
- Maintain meticulous records of exposures and retakes.

## Key Terms & Definitions
- **ALARA** — As Low As Reasonably Achievable radiation protection principle.  
- **Kilovoltage Peak (kVp)** — Controls beam quality/penetrating power.  
- **Milliamperage (mA)** — Controls quantity of x-ray photons.  
- **Exposure Time** — Duration x-rays are produced; affects density.  
- **Paralleling Technique** — Receptor parallel to tooth, central ray perpendicular.  
- **Bisecting Angle Technique** — Central ray perpendicular to imaginary angle bisector between tooth and receptor.  
- **Cone Cut** — Clear area due to misaligned PID.  
- **Foreshortening/Elongation** — Distortion from incorrect vertical angulation.  
- **Cumulative Dose** — Total lifetime radiation exposure.  
- **Dosimeter Badge** — Monitors occupational exposure.

## Didactic Content
### Radiation Physics & Biology
- Components of x-ray tubehead, step-up/down transformers, filament heating.  
- Interaction with matter (photoelectric effect, Compton scatter).  
- Somatic vs. genetic effects, dose-response relationship, tissue weighting factors.

### Protection & Compliance
- Filtration, collimation, PID length, lead aprons/thyroid collars, selection criteria.  
- Operator position rule (6 ft, 90–135°), dosimetry, equipment QA tests.  
- Georgia Board requirements for radiography permit.

### Imaging Techniques
- Bitewing sequencing, posterior/periapical order, edentulous modifications, pediatric considerations.  
- Panoramic positioning errors (chin up/down, anterior-posterior, tongue placement).  
- Infection control for XCP, sensors, lead aprons.

### Interpretation Basics
- Identifying lamina dura, periodontal ligament space, caries classification, bone levels, pathology alerts.

### Digital Imaging & Emerging Technologies
- Compare direct digital sensors, phosphor storage plates (PSP), and traditional film; discuss resolution, patient comfort, and workflow impacts.  
- Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) overview: assistant responsibilities for patient prep, safety screening, and data handling (note: GA assistants gather data, dentist interprets).  
- Artificial intelligence decision-support tools—benefits, limitations, ethical considerations, and requirement for dentist oversight.  
- Data security: DICOM exports, encryption, and HIPAA-compliant sharing with specialists.

### Quality Assurance Program
| QA Element | Frequency | Assistant Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Darkroom/light leak check (if film) | Semiannual | Conduct coin test, document results, schedule repairs |
| Sensor calibration & cleaning | Weekly | Inspect for damage, sanitize per manufacturer, log findings |
| Exposure chart review | Quarterly | Compare default settings to patient outcomes, recommend updates |
| Dosimeter badge submission | Monthly | Collect staff badges, send to vendor, file exposure reports |
| Panoramic alignment audit | Weekly | Use positioning phantom to verify magnification/ghosting limits |

### Interactive Activity – Radiography QA Vocabulary
(H5P: `M6_H5P_RadiographyMarks`)

Click all terms that belong in the ALARA-compliant QA workflow (retake analysis, kVp/mA documentation, dosimeter submission, panoramic alignment cues). Use the summary to update your QA binder checklist.

## Laboratory / Skills
- **Manikin Practice:** Paralleling on full-mouth series; evaluate using error chart.  
- **Digital Workflow:** Sensor barrier placement, exposure, image capture, labeling, secure storage.  
- **Panoramic Machine Lab:** Positioning, bite block use, lead apron placement.  
- **QA Station:** Perform coin tests, sensor calibration, and document in QA log.  
- **Interpretation Rounds:** Small groups analyze anonymized radiographs for caries, periodontal bone loss, periapical pathology, and faulty restorations; present findings using standardized terminology.  
- Safety: lead barriers, dosimeter use, only essential personnel in operatory, signage posted.  
- **Competency Sign-off:** Submit full-mouth series with ≤2 retakes and accurate mounting.

## Assessments
- Written exam on physics, protection, regulations.  
- Lab practical evaluation for sensor placement and exposure factor selection.  
- Image error worksheet (identify and correct problems).  
- QA documentation project: students complete a mock monthly QA packet including exposure charts, retake analysis, and dosimeter summary.  
- OSCE station: verbalize patient instructions, adjust settings for pediatric bitewings, and troubleshoot a sensor artifact scenario.

## Documentation & Records
- Exposure log, retake analysis form, equipment QA checklist, patient release for radiograph duplication.
