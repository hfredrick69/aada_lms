# Module 8: Preventive Dentistry & Patient Education

**Program:** Atlanta Academy of Dental Assisting – 1200-Hour Dental Assistant Certificate Program  
**Unit:** Unit 2 – Core Clinical Skills  
**Module:** Module 8 – Preventive Dentistry & Patient Education  
**Hours:** 35 Didactic / 30 Lab / 0 Clinical  
**Standards:** ABHES (Dental Assisting), OSHA, CDC; State: Georgia

## Purpose
Enable students to deliver evidence-based preventive services, oral hygiene instruction, dietary counseling, and fluoride/sealant support that improve patient outcomes.

## Learning Objectives (by Domain)
**Cognitive:**
- Explain caries etiology, biofilm dynamics, and remineralization strategies.  
- Compare fluoride delivery methods (systemic vs. topical) and indications.  
- Describe sealant criteria, materials, and retention factors.  
- Outline patient education strategies for different age groups and cultural needs.  
- Summarize nutrition counseling principles related to oral health.

**Psychomotor:**
- Demonstrate plaque disclosure, brushing, flossing, and interdental aid instruction.  
- Assist with sealant placement steps (etch, rinse, dry, apply, cure).  
- Prepare written postoperative instructions and preventive plans.  
- Record nutritional risk findings in EHR.

**Affective:**
- Encourage patient motivation through positive reinforcement.  
- Respect patient autonomy and preferences when co-developing care plans.  
- Show sensitivity while discussing diet, tobacco cessation, or substance use.

## Key Terms & Definitions
- **Biofilm** — Structured community of microorganisms adhering to surfaces within a self-produced matrix.  
- **Demineralization** — Loss of mineral content from enamel/dentin due to acid attack.  
- **Remineralization** — Re-deposition of minerals aided by fluoride, saliva, and calcium/phosphate agents.  
- **Fluoride Varnish** — High-concentration topical fluoride painted onto teeth for sustained release.  
- **Sealant** — Resin-based preventive coating placed in pits and fissures to block bacteria.  
- **CAMBRA** — Caries Management by Risk Assessment tool.  
- **Motivational Interviewing** — Counseling style promoting behavior change using patient-centered dialogue.  
- **Interdental Aids** — Tools such as floss threaders, interdental brushes, and water flossers.  
- **Nutritional Counseling** — Assessment and guidance regarding diet’s impact on oral health.  
- **Plaque Disclosure** — Application that stains biofilm for visualization.

## Didactic Content
### Caries & Periodontal Disease Prevention
- Demineralization threshold (critical pH), saliva buffering, protective factors.  
- Risk assessment forms covering medical history, diet, fluoride exposure, socioeconomic determinants.  
- Periodontal health promotion, antimicrobial rinses, probiotic considerations.

### Fluoride Therapies
- Systemic sources (community water, supplements) vs. topical forms (varnish, gel, foam).  
- Safety: proper dosing, contraindications (allergy, swallowing risk).  
- Application frequency recommendations by age/risk level.

### Sealants & Preventive Resins
- Tooth selection, isolation requirements, etch/rinse/dry cycle, curing, evaluation, maintenance.

### Patient Education & Communication
- Teach-back method, SMART goals for home care, cultural competence, readability of take-home materials.  
- Diet logs, sugar exposure frequency, hidden fermentable carbohydrates.  
- Tobacco/vaping cessation resources, caries-risk motivational interviewing prompts.

### Special Populations & Health Equity
- Prenatal and perinatal oral health counseling—managing pregnancy gingivitis, safety of fluoride/varnish, and collaboration with OB providers.  
- Pediatric behavior guidance (tell-show-do, modeling, positive reinforcement) and adaptations for special health care needs (desensitization visits, weighted blankets, caregiver involvement).  
- Geriatric prevention: root caries, xerostomia management, salivary substitutes, medication review, and denture hygiene instruction.  
- Community-level interventions: school sealant programs, mobile dentistry logistics, integration with Georgia Department of Public Health initiatives.

### Interactive Activity – Preventive Planning Quiz
(H5P: `M8_H5P_PreventiveMultiChoice`)

Select all preventive strategies that match a high-risk CAMBRA profile (fluoride varnish, xylitol support, MI-based diet coaching). Discuss why the distractors increase caries risk.

### Data Tracking & Quality Improvement
- Use of caries-risk dashboards in the EHR to monitor patient cohorts, recall compliance, and sealant retention rates.  
- Documentation of preventive services for insurance coding (D1206 fluoride varnish, D1351 sealant) and reporting to state programs.  
- Continuous quality improvement cycles (Plan-Do-Study-Act) applied to missed preventive opportunities; assistants help collect data and recommend workflow adjustments.

## Laboratory / Skills
- **OHI Station:** Students practice brushing/flossing demos on typodonts and peers, using disclosing agents.  
- **Sealant Lab:** Simulated molar sealant application with isolation, etching, curing, evaluation.  
- **Education Material Workshop:** Create bilingual-friendly handouts, test readability using SMOG index.  
- **Risk Assessment Case Conferencing:** Teams analyze anonymized patient charts, assign CAMBRA categories, propose tailored interventions, and document in mock EHRs.  
- **Community Outreach Simulation:** Design a mobile-clinic preventive station layout, including patient flow, infection control checkpoints, and culturally relevant education props.  
- PPE: safety glasses, masks, gloves; isolate using dry angles/cotton to prevent contamination.  
- **Competency Sign-off:** Accurate sealant placement with full retention upon instructor inspection and effective education script demonstration.

## Assessments
- Preventive care plan assignment for pediatric and adult case scenarios.  
- Sealant practical rubric (surface prep, isolation, application, QA).  
- Short quiz on fluoride indications and dosage calculations.  
- Motivational interviewing video submission evaluated for empathy, open-ended questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries (OARS).  
- Quality-improvement proposal summarizing baseline preventive metrics, goals, and action steps for a mock practice.

## Documentation & Records
- CAMBRA form, sealant consent and charting template, fluoride varnish record, dietary recall log.
- Community outreach tracking sheet (participants served, services delivered, referrals) and preventive dashboard screenshots for QA files.

## ABHES / OSHA / CDC Cross-Reference
- ABHES DA3, DA6; OSHA PPE for sealant/fluoride procedures; CDC recommendations for caries prevention and fluoride safety.

## Required Resources
- Typodonts, plaque disclosing swabs, toothbrushes, floss, interdental aids, sealant kits, curing lights, fluoride varnish, educational brochures, translation aids.
