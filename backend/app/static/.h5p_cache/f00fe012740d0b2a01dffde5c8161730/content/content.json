I can document the refusal and provide the education points we covered so quality still sees the patient interaction.\"</p><ul><li>Reaffirm policy and scope of practice.</li><li>Offer to document refusal coding or follow-up tasks.</li><li>Escalate through the compliance chain if pressure continues.</li></ul>"
