  "textField": "<p>The radiographer should document *retake-analysis* results each month and compare exposure rates to the clinic's baseline. When calibrating sensors, record the *kVp* and *mA* settings used for the phantom so the QA log reflects real-world techniques. Protective aprons and thyroid collars must be disinfected and the *dosimeter-badge* submissions filed or scanned into the QA binder. If a panoramic study shows repeated *chin-tipped-down* errors, assistants should launch an in-service before the next compliance audit. Retention of digital images requires *HIPAA-compliant* storage with user-level permissions.</p>",
