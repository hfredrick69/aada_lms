## 1) Welcome to AADA (Georgia Context)
**Mission:** Prepare entry-level dental assistants with the technical, ethical, and professional skills necessary to contribute to Georgia dental practices.  
**Regulatory context:** AADA operates under Georgia’s **GNPEC Minimum Standards** (O.C.G.A. § 20-3-250.*) and adheres to **Programmatic Integrity** requirements (clear objectives; theory + practice; assessment; remediation; final evaluation).  
- GNPEC **Std 1** requires: objectives, curriculum outline, theoretical & practical components, assessment, remediation, final evaluation, syllabi/lesson plans.  
- Unaccredited programs cannot be fully asynchronous; **direct, meaningful faculty interaction is required**. Hands-on public-health related training must occur **in person**.  
- You’ll attend 1 live kickoff and in-person skills activities later in the program.

**Learning Objectives (Module 1):**
- Explain professionalism and ethics in Georgia dental settings.
- Summarize HIPAA privacy rules and OSHA safety basics relevant to dental practices.
- Navigate the AADA LMS; locate Catalog/Enrollment Agreement policies: SAP, grading, complaint, refund, and cancellation.
- Demonstrate awareness of student records and transcript processes.

## 2) Professionalism & Ethics (Georgia Practice)
**Professional conduct:** Dental assistants in Georgia are expected to display honesty, confidentiality, accountability, punctuality, and respect for diverse patients and co-workers.  
**Ethical decision framework:**  
1. Identify patient interest and potential risks.  
2. Review legal/ethical requirements (HIPAA privacy, OSHA safety).  
3. Consult policy or supervisor.  
4. Choose the safest, most ethical action; document when appropriate.

**Case Study – Confidential Screen:**   
You notice a patient chart left visible at check-in. The ethical and compliant response: cover and secure PHI, notify a supervisor, and remind the team of workstation privacy procedures.

> **H5P Activity 1 – Branching Scenario:** “Coworker violates HIPAA” — choose the correct action and receive feedback.

## 3) HIPAA (45 CFR Part 164) & OSHA (29 CFR 1910) Essentials
**HIPAA Privacy Rule** requires that Protected Health Information (PHI) is accessed/used/disclosed only as permitted; “minimum necessary” applies.  
**Typical violations:** unattended monitors with visible PHI, discussing PHI in public areas, unsecured paper charts.  
**Your role:** Always shield screens, verify authorization, and use proper communication etiquette (e.g., private areas for PHI).

**OSHA in dental practice (29 CFR 1910):**  
- **PPE:** masks, gloves, eyewear/face shields as appropriate.  
- **Exposure control:** sharps handling, post-exposure protocols, labeling, and engineering controls.  
- **Infection control tie-in:** Instrument reprocessing (clean → package → sterilize → store).  
While detailed chairside and sterilization labs occur later, new students must understand basic OSHA/CDC principles now.

> **H5P Activity 2 – Interactive Video:** At 00:12, hotspot prompts “Cover patient file” with feedback and rationale.

---

## 4) Communication & Team Dynamics
**Goals:** Patient-centered, clear, empathetic communication; teamwork that anticipates the dentist’s needs; precise procedure hand-offs.  
**Examples:**  
- When running behind: “Thank you for your patience. We’re preparing the operatory to ensure safety and quality for your care.”  
- Peer safety prompt: “Let’s grab a new pair of gloves before we continue.”

> **H5P Activity 3 – Dialog Cards:** Practice AADA-approved phrases for common front-office and chairside situations.
