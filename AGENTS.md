# Codex Agent – AADA_LMS

instructions: ./.codex/instructions.md

description: |
  This agent configures Codex for the AADA Learning Management System.
  It loads project-specific conventions (FastAPI backend, React/TypeScript frontend,
  and React admin portal) and inherits the global engineer persona from
  ~/.codex/global_instructions.md.
