# AADA Admin Portal

Secure, role-aware administration dashboard for the AADA Learning Management System. The portal is a React + Vite SPA styled with TailwindCSS and communicates with the FastAPI backend via JWT authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (used for the LMS stack)
- Existing backend and PostgreSQL containers running from the LMS project

## Environment Variables

Configured in `admin_portal/.env` (used at build-time by Vite):

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Internal URL for backend (Docker network). | `http://backend:8000/api` |
| `VITE_APP_NAME` | Display name used inside the UI. | `AADA Admin Portal` |
| `VITE_JWT_SECRET` | Must match FastAPI `SECRET_KEY` for token validation helpers. | `supersecretkey_change_me` |

> When running outside Docker (e.g., `npm run dev` locally), point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:8000/api`.

## Roles & Permissions

| Role | Description | Key Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Admin** | Superuser for policy & infrastructure oversight. | All sections (Students, Courses, Payments, Externships, Reports, Settings). |
| **Instructor** | Faculty operations & clinical oversight. | Dashboard, Courses, Externships. |
| **Finance** | Tuition, invoices, and refund compliance. | Dashboard, Payments, Reports. |
| **Registrar** | Enrollment and academic record custody. | Dashboard, Students, Reports. |

Role enforcement happens client-side (route guard) and should be mirrored server-side on protected endpoints.

## Local Development (Optional)

```bash
cd admin_portal
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server runs on <http://localhost:5173>. Adjust `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` if you are not running inside Docker.

## Docker Deployment

1. From the LMS project root:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build admin_portal
   docker-compose up admin_portal
   ```
2. Visit <http://localhost:5173> for the portal.
3. The service joins the default Docker network and talks to the FastAPI container via the `backend` alias (added in `docker-compose.yml`).

### Networking Notes

- The existing backend service (named `web`) has a network alias `backend` ensuring requests to `http://backend:8000` resolve inside the Compose network.
- CORS must allow `http://localhost:5173`; update FastAPI middleware if requests are blocked.

## Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`.
2. JWT (access token) is stored in the in-memory auth context (never persisted to `localStorage`).
3. An Axios interceptor appends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on subsequent requests.
4. `GET /api/auth/me` resolves user profile + roles for route gating.

> Seed data creates an admin account: `admin@aada.edu` / `AdminPass!23`. Update or disable via `app/db/seed.py` as needed.

If authentication fails, the portal resets state and displays the API error message.

## Feature Overview

- **Dashboard:** Enrollment, program, finance, and externship snapshots.
- **Students:** CRUD interface with enrollment visibility (Registrar/Admin).
- **Courses:** Program/module explorer with clock-hour tracking (Instructor/Admin).
- **Payments:** Invoice list & mark-as-paid controls (Finance/Admin).
- **Externships:** Assignment, hour tracking, verification workflow (Instructor/Admin).
- **Reports:** CSV/PDF exports via `/reports/compliance/{resource}`.
- **Settings:** Reference for role capabilities and API directions.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 401 Unauthorized | Ensure the FastAPI backend has matching `SECRET_KEY` and the LMS auth endpoints are reachable. |
| CORS errors | Update FastAPI CORS middleware to allow `http://localhost:5173` (and Docker hostnames). |
| Network name resolution | Confirm `web` service exposes alias `backend` (provided in `docker-compose.yml`). |
| Missing API endpoints | Placeholder data renders when API calls fail; verify backend routers expose the required paths. |

## Production Notes

- For production builds use `npm run build` and serve `dist/` with a static server (e.g., Nginx). Update Dockerfile accordingly.
- Consider securing the portal with SSO and HTTPS termination at the ingress or reverse proxy.

Maintained alongside the AADA LMS backend. For changes to backend endpoints, update the API helpers in `src/api/`.
